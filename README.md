## Testing

Exercise 1. 
Installed the following tools and libraries:
- Robot Framework
- Browser Library
- Requests library
- CryptoLibrary
- Robotidy

Exercise 2. 
Conducted a test with Robot Framework and Browser Library to test login functionality. 
The test was passed. 

Exercise 3. 
Practiced using Robot Framework on https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/web/web-form.html: selecting options from dropdowns, checking and unchecking checkboxes and radioboxes, picking color etc. 

Exercise 4. 
Tested the "create new entry" functionality on my projectâ€™s website using Robot Framework. Since this feature requires authentication, I first reused the login test from Exercise 2. After successfully logging in, I automated the process of creating a new entry. The test was passed. 

Exercise 5. 
Did login testing using credentials from .env file. 
See: log.html, report.html, output.xml

Exercise 6. 
Did login testing using credentials crypted with CryptoLibrary and CryptoClient. 
See: log.html, report.html, output.xml
